Insights about ecological state of human beings.

## Ressurgent Ecologies
The comparison between "developed" vs "developing" countries is fallacious because it's not like the developed country has reached its pinnacle and stopped developing! The dynamism among cities, city-states, states and nations is ever evolving. 

Even the terms [Emerging Markets or Emerging Economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_market) is untenable and politically dicey. The worst terminologies that are extremely prejudiced and biggoted are that of [First World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World) vs [Third World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World) countries. 

Consequently, the most important ecological insight a person can have, regardless of the terminologies used in a dialogue or a discussion, is that nCovids cannot possibly give a bacteria's rear-end about our geopolitical boundaries or alignments! 

In this sense, trying to assert the political sovereignty of a figurehead over a geographic region is futile in the face of the current nCoV pandemic. Most importantly, it is worth understanding that socio-econonomic and political conflicts arise from futile and unsustainable maxims and practicies. 

Here the terms futile are in the sense of [Muda (無駄)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muda_(Japanese_term)) and unsustainable in the sense of [Muri (無理)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muri_(Japanese_term)).

So naturally, it is necessary to implement federated standards of sustainability with equitable wealth distribution at the global scale to prevent the occurance or propagation of cataclysmic, extinction grade events like the ongoing pandemic.

Lack of globally federated standards for sustainability and equity distribution is an example of basic [Mura(斑)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mura_(Japanese_term)) that plagues humanity as a whole. Certainly, it must be avoided in the first place or swiftly curtailed as soon as it arises.
