Insights about ecological state of human beings.

## Resurgent Ecologies
The comparison between "developed" vs "developing" countries is fallacious because it's not like the developed country has reached its pinnacle and stopped developing! The dynamism among cities, city-states, states and nations is ever evolving. 

Even the terms [Emerging Markets or Emerging Economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_market) is untenable and politically dicey. The worst terminologies that are extremely prejudiced and biggoted are that of [First World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World) vs [Third World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World) countries. 

Consequently, the most important ecological insight a person can have, regardless of terminologies used in a discussion, is that nCovids cannot possibly give a bacteria's rear-end about our geopolitical boundaries or alignments! 

From this ecological insight it naturally follows that a figurehead trying to assert political sovereignty over a geographic region is futile in the face of ongoing pandemic. It is worth acknowledging that socio-econonomic and political conflicts essentially arise from futile and unsustainable maxims and practicies. 

Here the term *futile* is used in the sense of [Muda (無駄)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muda_(Japanese_term)) and *unsustainable* in the sense of [Muri (無理)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muri_(Japanese_term)).

From a cybernetics perspective, it is obvious that the poorest, weakest and most uneducated people across the globe become the strongest vectors for propegating digital and biological viruses. So naturally, it is necessary to implement federated standards of sustainability with equitable access to health and education at the global scale. This is of paramount importance to prevent the occurance and propagation of cataclysmic, extinction grade events like the ongoing pandemic. 

Lack of globally federated standards for sustainability and equity distribution is an example of basic [Mura(斑)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mura_(Japanese_term)) that plagues humanity as a whole. Certainly, it must be avoided in the first place or swiftly remedied as soon as it arises.
